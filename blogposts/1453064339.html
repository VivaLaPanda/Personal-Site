<p>The custom post system is fully up and running! I still need to do some CSS tweaks on the site, and make it work on mobile. After that, I&#39;m planning to work more on the Yen site. I&#39;m rebuilding from scratch in Laravel, so that will be quite the endeavor, but hopefully will make things easier in the long run. This blog should be updated mainly with whatever I&#39;m working on, but also occasionally with more personal updates.</p>
